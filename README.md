# WifiConection
This is a way to make a wifi conection between two or more computers. In addition, all of them can use the same master on ros, working together.

(ATTENTION: THE MASTER-CLIENT PART THATS NOT WORKING. FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS ON WIKI ROS. LINK ON 'STEPBYSTEPOLD.TXT' FILE)

## Instructions
  In computer1 run the program "hot-master". There will be the ros-master.
  After that, in computer2 (and in others, if you want), run "con-client".

  If you want to break the relation between hotspot-server and ros-master, you can run 'hotspot' and 'conecting' to make the wifi conection on your way.
  Then, choose your computers to run 'master' and 'client' by your way.

## Step-By-Step Option
  If the first way don't works, you can follow my daft of connecton on 'StepByStepOLD.txt'.

## Attention
 Thats a BETA, so there is a lot o problems on that sollution. For example, during my tests, I could run perfectly the programs in a sense, but, when I changed the computers 1 and 2, i couldn't connect on wifi created.
 
## 'ReferenceWifi.txt'
 Thats an initial search that I made about wifi connection. After that, I simplified the way to make the connection, but you can use it if the sollutin doesn't work well.
 
Please write me and tell me about your experience!
